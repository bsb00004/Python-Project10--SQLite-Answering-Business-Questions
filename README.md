# Python-Project10-SQLite-Answering-Business-Questions

In this project, we're going to answer business questions using our SQL skills like: SQL joining, using subqueries, multiple joins, set operations, aggregate functions and more. We are using diffrent tasks in every steps to go through all of the SQL skills:

- Write a SQL query to extract the relevant data
- Create plots where necessary to visualize the data
- Write a short paragraph, drawing conclusions and explaining the data and/or visualizations.

We are using the Chinook database, which is provided as a SQLite database file called __chinook.db__. A copy of the database schema is below - we'll need to come back to this step often to consult the schema as we write your queries.

It's worth remembering that our database retains 'state', so if we run a query with a CREATE or DROP twice, the query will fail.  But if you have trouble, or if you manage to lock your database, we have provided a __chinook-unmodified.db__ file that you can copy over the __chinook.db__ to restore it back to its initial state (see [this blog post on how to run shell commands within a Jupyter notebook](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/#17executingshellcommands)).

Here are a few tips to keep in mind while working on these queries:

- Write your query in stages, and run it as you go to make sure at each stage it's producing the output you expect.
- If something isn't behaving as you expect, break parts of the query out into their own, separate queries to make sure there's not an inner logic error.
- Don't be afraid to write separate queries to check the underlying data, for instance you might write a query that you can use to manually check a calculation and give yourself confidence that the output you're seeing is correct.
